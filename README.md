# make-pihole-pi4
Docker compose configuration for a Pi-hole app, for using my raspberry pi as an ad-blocking DNS server.

See the comments in **docker-compose.yml** for information on configuration.

**Note:** It's a good idea to reserve the IP address of your server. See your router configuration for this. Or just use Pi-hole as your DHCP server!
